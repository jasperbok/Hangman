Hangman Readme

I'm not a good follower of tutorials. In a tutorial all the thinking is done for you, meaning you only get to use some commands that you'll forget a few hours after you've used them. Therefore, I just read a few things about Python and started my own little project to discover and learn Python 3.

This project is just that: a small personal project to teach myself some basic Python. If you happen to come across this project and you have some suggestions for me, by all means: tell me :) I'd love some feedback and tips from more experienced programmers.

Thanks!

Jasper
